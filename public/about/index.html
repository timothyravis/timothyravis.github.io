<meta name="twitter:description" content="Tim is an urban planner and geographer whose research focuses on the political economy of mapping in domestic and international development programming in Indonesia. Geospatial representation involves not only geometric and geographic assumptions, but ontological and ideological ones as well. Who benefits when it is standardized?
He&rsquo;s also a data- and compsci-curious, and is excited to get beyond writing dinky R scripts and into stuff like&hellip;setting up his own website. And thinking about how computational capacity is transforming our economies, societies, and politics."/>
